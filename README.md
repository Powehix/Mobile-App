# About

This is an inventory scanner application developed as part of an undergraduate paper.
The application allows scanning QR codes and making an inventory in the rooms chosen by users from the list, which is stored in the database. 

## Getting Started

Connection to the database is described in the file mysql1.dart. Please change the installed settings to work with your database, in particular, you must change the hostname, password, database ID and port.

*Note: MySQL must be used as the DBMS.*

Connected dependecies:
- [flutter_barcode_scanner](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_barcode_scanner)
- [mysql1](https://pub.dev/packages/mysql1)
- [vibration](https://pub.dev/packages/vibration)

Connected dependencies are described in the file pubspec.yaml. Please make sure that the installed versions are up to date before you start.

The application allows you to read QR codes generated by the [web application](https://github.com/Powehix/web-app-java). A format containing only numerical values is considered correct, as its identifier in the database is used to identify the scanned object, a field that has a unique automatically and unencrypted value. 

Please make sure that the information stored in the QR code is correct with the regular scanner in the mobile app. You can also generate a QR code using online generators such as [this one](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/).
